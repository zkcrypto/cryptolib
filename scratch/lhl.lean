Claim 5.3: Let G be some finite Abelian group and let l be some integer. For any l elements g₁,...,gₗ  ∈ G consider the statistical distance between the uniform distribution on G and the distribution given by the sum of a random subset of g₁,...,gₗ. Then the expectation of this statistical distance over a uniform choice of g₁,...,gₗ ∈ G is at most (∣G∣/2ˡ)^(1/2) In particular, the probability that this statistical distance is more than (∣G∣/2ˡ)^1/4 is at most (∣G∣/2ˡ)^1/4.
